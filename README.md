# KDE/Plasma Factory Reset

This program will wipe your kde settings back to "factory", or first run status, or as close as I (perhaps we) can manage to get them.

## Warning/Disclaimer
This is an actively descructive program and will delete multiple files, folders, and settings that are core to KDE/Plasma to bring it back to first run state. While the program has an optional backup method that will backup absolutely everything it will be deleting. I am not responsible for lost data, loss of limb, or phalus stuck in object that may occur during use of this software.

## Making it better
Ultimately I would like for this to cover anything and everything that may be within the KDE/Plasma ecosystem, but that's a rather wide net, and this is meant to specifically handle core configuration, so many concessions are made due to a combination of moral dilemmas (user contacts and email for example), and "do we really need to" dilemmas (removing applications folder for example).

My ultimate hope, is that someone can take the basic structure I've built here, and work it into the system settings, with the ability to check off what we do, and do not, wish to keep. The end goal being, when major updates occur, and old configs inevitably break things, we can just push a button, wipe the configs, resetup our desktops, and just get on with our lives without wiping the entirety of our user configs for everything else.

As for how others can contribute to this project specifically, I highly doubt I covered everything, I doubt the method is the best, or even that great to begin with. So code that makes this better, or folder locations/process' I may have missed, would be greatly welcome.
